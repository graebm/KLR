# Run the NKI frontend's gather step from a local build
#
# In order for this to work, you must set PY_VER to a supported
# python version, and you must have a executable named python${PY_VER}
# pointing to that Python interpreter.
# If you installed python through brew, then you should already have
# this. The default is version 3.10, this choice is arbitrary.
#
# You must also have run make in the interop/klr directory for the
# python version that you are using. For example:
#
#   cd interop/klr
#   make PY_VER=3.10
#
# Will build the Python 3.10 version of the NKI frontend.
